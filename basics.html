                    <h1>Narrative</h1>
                    <p> The first and foremost factor of film fundamentals
                         is the narrative or the “story” as it is better known by
                          most people. In laneman’s terms, the narrative is a form of
                           storytelling that conveys and presents a certain order of 
                           events for the film to revolve around. Evidently, cinema 
                           contains various types of narratives like classical 
                           narratives, artistic narratives (stylistic meaning 
                           surpasses the story in importance), and radical narrative 
                           (essentially propaganda), but for the sake of simplicity, 
                           we’ll stick to the general standard of classical narratives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ordinarily, Storytelling is best known for following the general 
                        standard plot progression, Freytag’s Pyramid, with essential 
                        narrative elements like agents, actions, sequence, and narration. 
                        However, causal storytelling also entails a circular progression of
                         the narrative. This circle begins with a state of equilibrium for
                          exposition, which is then disrupted by action (development). 
                          Lastly, the story returns to equilibrium-like state despite being 
                          transformed from the original state.   
                    </p>

                            This form of storytelling can be divided into three
                            parts: Plot, Story, and Narration. Despite sounding,
                            virtually, the same, these aspects differ in their
                            purpose to the overarching meaning of a narrative.

                    <h1>Mise-en-scene</h1>
                    <p>Mise-en-scene or “staging a scene” pertains to the direct control 
                        of elements found within the frame. In other words, it is the film’s
                         stylistic treatment of visual elements and selected qualities. </p>

                         <p>Generally, mise-en-scene can be divided into two sections: design 
                        and composition. Design refers to the visual aspects of physical
                         elements that are organized to evoke spatial and temporal mapping,
                          meaning, mood, and ideas. </p>
                        
                          <p>For design, the physical elements include setting, décor (patterns),
                         props, costume, makeup, hair, and lighting. Every visual element 
                         has a purpose and meaning that adheres to the director’s vision to
                          enhance the film. In other words, a pattern of coherence for
                           meaningful visual motifs, relationships and similarities on screen. </p>
                        
                           <p>Generally, composition refers to the organization, distribution,
                         relationship and balance between objects and subjects (points of 
                         focus on screen). Composition can create dynamic patterns, guide 
                         our attention, present ideas, and establish relationships. </p>
                        
                         <p>Two important elements to note in terms of composition are framing 
                        (on & offscreen space) and movement. Framing can be utilized to
                         explicitly convey action, imply events offscreen, and establish 
                         changeable perspectives. Movement amplifies this as the actions 
                         of figures and objects can establish some significance.  </p>

                    <h1>Cinematography</h1>
                    <p>Cinematography is the technological manipulation of film during 
                        shooting and post-production. Unlike design. Cinematography is more
                         about the technical means by which visual elements are communicated 
                         like the inner workings of the camera through the lenses, light, 
                         stock, and speed of motion. 

                        Film stock is the physical stock that runs through the camera.
                         Most films used to primarily use stock until the wave of digital 
                         enhancement introduced DV (digital Video) to rise with better
                          accessibility, manipulation and higher speeds.  
                        
                        <ul>  <li>Speed of Motion or the standard rate of shooting a shot are the 
                        classic 24 frames per second, which can be altered.	</li> 
                        <li>Fewer fps = accelerated motion</li>
                        <li>More fps = slow motion</li></ul>
                        
                        Framing for cinematography entails three factors that affect our 
                        engagement: size & shape, implied proximity, and angle & height. 
                        
                        There are many standard shot types and camera angles that are utilized in film. </p>

                    <h1>Editing</h1>
                    <p>Editing is an essential aspect of films that is
                    often neglected for most viewers despite being
                    such an integral part of their experience. 
                    Essentially, Editing is the coordination and 
                    manipulation of one shot to another. The Editor
                    bears a lot of responsibility in selecting,
                    arranging, and assembling individual shots
                    into a complete whole. 

                    Depending on the type of film, the edited shots
                    could be meaningful, coherent, disruptive, chaotic. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A shot is an uninterrupted image </li>
                        <li>A cut is an instantaneous change from one shot to another</li></ul> 
                        
                    <p>Generally speaking, Editing has four relations or
                    factors: Graphic, Spatial, Rhythmic, and Temporal.
                    When editing in terms of graphic relations, this 
                    means that shots are edited in terms of how similar 
                    they are visually.</p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Graphic match – cutting to a shot with similar visuals.</li> 
                        
                            <li>Contrast – self-explanatory</li>  
                        
                                <li>Rhythmic relations pertain to the duration and tempo
                                    of shots and cuts. For example, when the action builds
                                    up and shots decrease in duration, this is called an 
                                    accelerated montage. This creates suspense as the rhythm of the scene accelerates.</li> 
                        
                                    <li>Spatial relations are straight forward as they refer to shots with similar spaces / settings.</li> 
                        
                                        <li>Lastly, temporal relations are edited shots that are chronological or alinear in the film’s timeline.</li></ul>
                        
                    <p><strong>Continuity Editing</strong> – maintains a clear, continuous, and cohesive use of spatial and temporal relations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Discontinuity editing</strong> – deliberately disrupts the flow of shots and entails rough transitions and poor cohesion.</p>

                    <h1>Sound</h1>
                    <h3>“The eyes see better when the sound is great.” - Steven Spielberg </h3>
                    <p>Sound is very straightforward but a fundamental aspect of film as it can 
                        direct our attention, confirm visual information, or complicate them.
                         Sound & visuals are co-expressible as the pair work hand in hand to provide information.                          
                        Sound has four predominant types in film: Dialogue, Ambience, Silence, and Music.   
                        Dialogue can be any recorded form of speech, narration, or audible words expressed from a character.                        
                        Ambience refers to environmental sounds within the scene.</p>

                    <p> In film, silence is considered a powerful sound as it can evoke feelings of suspense and surprise. 
                        Music can generally direct emotions or anchor itself to the visuals
                         of the film like a leitmotif (classical music). Music can also
                          establish a rift or tension between itself and the images on
                           screen (non-classical). </p>
                        <p>Music also has four fundamentals with their own branching factors:</p> 
                    <strong>Perceptual characteristics:</strong>                         
                        <ul><li>Volume</li>                         
                            <li>Pitch </li>                         
                            <li>Timbre (quality) </li> </ul>

                    <strong>Source:</strong> 
                        <ul> <li>Diegetic vs. Non-diegetic (In movie world or not)   </li>                      
                        <li>Onscreen vs. Off screen   </li>                      
                        <li>External vs. Internal   </li>                      
                        <li>Fidelity to source</li>
                        <li>Direct vs. Post-synchronized </li> </ul>

                    <strong> Temporal dimensions: </strong>                         
                        <ul> <li>Synchronous vs. Asynchronous  </li>                       
                        <li>Simultaneous vs. Non-simultaneous </li>                        
                        <li>Ex. Sonic flashbacks or prelap sounds </li></ul>
                        
                    <strong> Rhythmic patterns:</strong>                          
                        <ul><li>Beats, tempo, accents </li> </ul>
                        
                        <p>Beyond the nuances of sound fundamentals, sound production 
                        itself consists of four phases: Design, recording, editing, and mixing.                         
                        In terms of design, sound should be integral to all phases of film 
                        production, as sound designers identify all sounds necessary to the
                         story for each shot.  </p>                       
                        Recording is self-explanatory, but most audio in films are recorded
                        on a separate device than cameras as the quality on microphone-specific 
                        devices entails more quality. This method is referred to as the 
                        Double-system recording.                         
                        Editing and mixing are similar in that record as sound designers
                        synchronize picture with sound and ultimately compile every single
                        edited track of dialogue, sound effect, and music into a complete film. </p>

                    <h1>Acting</h1>
                    <p>Acting in film is a creative contribution on the same level as 
                        mise-en-scene with a variety of nuances for each actor 
                        and their respective styles. Fundamentally, acting is
                         fragmented as films aren’t shot in one go. Because of
                        this, performances entail a collaborative artistic 
                        expression as it must consider the editing of certain 
                        scenes and the cinematography.</p>

                    <p>Acting also has two opposing styles: naturalistic and non-naturalistic. 
                        The most well-known naturalistic form of acting is method acting, as in
                        bringing out the psychological “truth” of a character through an
                        actor’s experiences. Non-naturalistic performances are inherently excessive and 
                        exaggerated to the point that the viewers can discern the performance. </p>  
                        
                        Moreover, acting consists of these four fundamentals that must be 
                        considered: Appropriateness. Inherent thoughtfulness, Expressive Coherence, and Wholeness.  

                       <ul><li>Naturalistic appropriateness entails convincing and transparent 
                            acting. Vice versa for non-naturalistic appropriateness. </li>
                        
                            <li>Inherent thoughtfulness refers to whether or not the 
                            actor openly expresses the character’s inner thoughts.
                            Does the character’s actions and thoughts feel natural or subtle? </li>
                            
                            <li>Non-naturalistic thoughtfulness creates an alienation 
                            effect as the actors explicitly convey the actor’s actions abruptly. </li>
                            
                            <li>Similar to inherent thoughtfulness, expressive coherence refers 
                            to the character’s actions and if it’s between the manner, setting
                            and behavior. </li> </ul>
                        
                        Rather than being representational, non-naturalistic expressive 
                        coherence is presentational and displays the actor’s craft/skills. 
                        
                        Lastly, wholeness relates to the consistent illusion of a seamless
                        character. On the other hand, non-naturalistic wholeness is
                        incoherent and fragmented.  </p>
